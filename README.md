# 🧠 Autoencoder Image Reconstruction

This project uses a **neural network** called an **autoencoder** to **reconstruct images**. It can work with images that are **different sizes** and any **number of images**.

## 📦 What Is This Project?

An **autoencoder** is a type of **AI model**. It learns how to:
- Make an image smaller (**compress**)
- Build it back (**reconstruct**)

This project helps you understand how machines can **learn from images**, even if you don’t know the image size or how many images you have.

## 📁 Input

- The input images can be **any size**
- You can use **any number** of images
- The project will **resize** and prepare them for training

## 🛠 Requirements

You need to install these Python libraries:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy opencv-python matplotlib
