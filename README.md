# 🧠 Autoencoder Image Reconstruction

This project uses a **neural network** called an **autoencoder** to **reconstruct images**. It can work with images that are **different sizes** and any **number of images**.

## 📦 What Is This Project?

An **autoencoder** is a type of **AI model**. It learns how to:
- Make an image smaller (**compress**)
- Build it back (**reconstruct**)

This project helps you understand how machines can **learn from images**, even if you don’t know the image size or how many images you have.

## 📁 Input

- The input images can be **any size**
- You can use **any number** of images
- The project will **resize** and prepare them for training

## 🛠 Requirements

You need to install these Python libraries:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy opencv-python matplotlib
▶️ How to Run
Download the project:
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/ChrisPheraphon/autoencoder-image-reconstruction.git
cd autoencoder-image-reconstruction
Put your images in the correct folder (check the code or instructions in the project).

Run the main Python file:
bash
Copy
Edit
python autoencoder.py
The model will train using your images.

After training, it will show:

The original image

The reconstructed image

You can compare them to see how well it works.

💬 Notes
The project works with any image size.

All images will be resized automatically.

You can use any number of images.

Image format: JPG or PNG recommended.

🧠 How the Model Works
The model uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

It trains by comparing input and output images.

The goal is to make the output image look close to the input image.
