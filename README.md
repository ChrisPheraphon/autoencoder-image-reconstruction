🧠 Autoencoder Image Reconstruction
This project uses a neural network called an autoencoder to reconstruct images. It can work with images that are different sizes and any number of images.

📦 What Is This Project?
An autoencoder is a type of AI model. It learns how to:

Make an image smaller (compress)

Build it back (reconstruct)

This project helps you understand how machines can learn from images, even if you don’t know the image size or how many images you have.

📁 Input
The input images can be any size

You can use any number of images

The project will resize and prepare them for training

🛠 Requirements
You need to install these Python libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install tensorflow numpy opencv-python matplotlib
▶️ How to Run
Download the project:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/ChrisPheraphon/autoencoder-image-reconstruction.git
cd autoencoder-image-reconstruction
Put your images in the correct folder (check the code or instructions in the project).

Run the main Python file:

bash
Copy
Edit
python autoencoder.py
The model will train using your images.

After training, it will show:

The original image

The reconstructed image

You can compare them to see how well it works.

📚 Notes
This project is flexible. You don’t need to know the image size.

You can use your own image folder.

It’s good for learning AI and autoencoders with real image data.
